# Overview
Create a Kotlin project that uses Drools.

The primary goal is invoking business rules within a Kotlin service.

The workflow is a Customer creates a Mortgage Loan and a Loan Officer is assigned to the loan.

## Database
Since this is a demo use the H2 in-memory database.

The database schema is found in src/main/resources/schema.sql.

Initial database loading is accomplished by src/main/resources/data.sql.

Very simple database 
* A MortgageLoan has a Customer and an optional LoanOfficer.
* Only primary keys and indices are used at this time.
* No foreign keys are used for database integrity.

## Drools 
The business rules are in src/main/resources/MORTGAGE_RULE.drl.

The configuration is in src/main/kotlin/com/example/mortgage/config/DroolsConfig.kt

The business rules are invoked by src/main/kotlin/com/example/mortgage/service/MortgageLoanServiceImpl.kt

```
rule "Customer missing phone"
  when
    $c : Customer(phone == null || phone.trim().isEmpty())
  then
    insert(MortgageLoanStatus.USER_INFO_INCOMPLETE);
end
```
The when portion checks to see if:
1. A Customer fact exists
1. The Customer.phone is null or an empty String

The then is Java code that inserts a new fact MortgageLoanStatus.USER_INFO_INCOMPLETE.

Inserting a new fact causes additional business rules to fire.

## Enhancements
* Add Rest Controllers
* Add Documents to the database and expand the business rules to provide a workflow based on which documents have been completed.
* Add Credit report and expand workflow to include approval/decline paths.
